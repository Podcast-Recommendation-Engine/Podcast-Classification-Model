She’s most likely going to grow up, start a family of her own and be laid to rest with them…right? \n\nThe Freedom For Gracie instagram posts about the 3 grave plots that were purchased far too prematurely. Apparently, the culprit is none other than Aaron. The patriarch. The father. The estranged ex-husband, who by the way, isn’t new to accusations…\n\nAnother glimpse at the Freedom For Gracie page provides some context: Did Aaron kill his own son Grant and is he trying to take down the rest of the family next? \n\nPolice are at a loss, the public is at a loss, until five years later when the case flips on its head. \n\nAngie is the one sitting in prison facing charges of murder for hire.  \n\nThis is the case of the Solomon family. \n\n\n\nFull show notes available at RottenMangoPodcast.com",
